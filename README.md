[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chris-prener/testDriveR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chris-prener/testDriveR)

The goal of testDriveR is to provide data sets for teaching statistics and data science courses. These are data that I use for teaching [SOC 4930 / SOC 5050](https://slu-soc5050.github.io) at [Saint Louis University](https://slu.edu).

Installation
------------

You can install testDriveR from [Github](https://github.com/chris-prener/testDriveR) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chris-prener/testDriveR")
```

Current Data
------------

The package currently contains three data tables:

-   `auto17` - A data set containing model year 2017 vehicles for sale in the United States
-   `gss16` - A data set containing a selection of variables related to work and education from the 2016 General Social Survey
-   `gss16_Miss` - A copy of `gss16` without missing data explicitly identified for teaching about missing data
-   `kerrich` - A data set containing 2000 trials of coin flips by John Edmund Kerrich
