# testDriveR <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />

The goal of testDriveR is to provide data sets for teaching statistics and data science courses. These are data that I use for teaching [SOC 4930 / SOC 5050](https://slu-soc5050.github.io) at [Saint Louis University](https://slu.edu).

## Installation

You can install testDriveR from [Github](https://github.com/chris-prener/testDriveR) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chris-prener/testDriveR")
```

## Current Data
The package currently contains one data table:

* `auto17` - A data set containing model year 2017 vehicles for sale in the United States

## Example

This is a basic example that shows you how to open and explore the `auto17` data:

```{r example}
## basic example code
library(testDriveR)
autoData <- auto17
str(autoData)
head(autoData)
```
